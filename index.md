## Welcome to my corner of the web.

I've recently started streaming some development on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/garethhubball) and thought that it might be a good idea to have somewhere that I can post up some companion posts as well as other random musings.

So far this is a rather small endeavour but I wouldd like to invite you to join me in either learning about [F#](https://fsharp.org) or spreading the word about F# and functional programming.
