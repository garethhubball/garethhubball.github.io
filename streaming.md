## TwitchDeck

Ever wanted to stream? Don't want to pay out for one of those streaming keyboards with the screens in the buttons? Well here's a treat for you: If you hop over to the [TwitchDeck Github repository](https://github.com/garethhubball/twitchdeck) then you can grab the source code to the control solution that is being built on stream.

## F# Fundamentals

I've noticed a distinct lack of resources for those with litte/no development background to help learn F# so I thought I'd create some. Please drop in on a Friday stream and watch the VODs if you'd like a refesher on anything. All questions are welcome!
